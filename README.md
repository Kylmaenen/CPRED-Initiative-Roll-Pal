# CPRED-Initiative-Roll-Pal
Sup chooms.
Yeah nothing much I just like to write READMEs cuz they make me feel like such a 'runner.

I'd like to specify some stuff if you're gonna use the InitiativeRoll Pal in your game:

1. 	Players still have to roll their dice 'cause if you don't let them do it they'll tryna kill ya.
	You need to enter their character's name (or whatever) and their final initiative value.
2.	To make things a little easier for ya, goons only need a name and their REF Value (if they sport
	some speedware or do synthcoke or whatever yeah add that to REF as a bonus). The daemon will roll
	a d10 for each of them, and even roll again if they crit! Just for the sake of it, a "!" will appear
	near the goon's name if they critted positive - a "?" if they critted negative.
3.	Goons' initiative values resulting in <1 will instead turn into 1.
4.	Ya don't have to reroll anything if goons and/or players get the same initiative value - the daemon
	sorts characters with the same value randomly. I think it's fair enough and I mean don't tell me
	you like't when all players must reroll indefinitely cause they keep rolling the same values as their
	chooms and even their foes! That's boring af shut up.

What you'll get in the end is a little list with both Players and goons in a decrescent order.
You're fukin welcome.


'nyway I just "made" this little thing with the help of Google Bard. 
I'm not in any way a programmer and even while polishing the code I've had no idea what the fuck I was doing except for the 
logic, "animations" and flavor text but yeah, having an AI making programs for you is top cyberpunk so stfu.

EDIT: My good friend Kagenashi helped me polish the code even more. Y'all need to suck his d--

Cheers from Pacifica!
